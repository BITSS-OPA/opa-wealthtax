This is a Shiny app that allows you to create your own wealth tax and explore its effects.

Choose your brackets and tax rate per bracket and see the overall tax revenue, the number of tax units affected by the tax, and a plot of average tax rate across possible values of wealth.

To launch the app, see the runApp.R script.

More capability to tune other parameters to come!

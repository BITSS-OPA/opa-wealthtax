This repository is part of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on Senator Elizabeth Warren's proposal for a wealth tax. It consist of three components:

1 - [An interactive plot](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/simulator_app/), which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given set of assumptions. Materials can be found in: [`code\interactive_visualization`](https://github.com/BITSS/opa-wealthtax/tree/master/code/interactive_visualization).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic document](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/), which details all data, code, and assumptions included in the analysis. Materials can be found in: [`code\dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/BITSS/opa-wealthtax/tree/master/code/dynamic_doc).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.  

This OPA was the result of a collaboration between UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the original authors of the analysis, and the [Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/) (BITSS).

This is the first collaborative case study on how to bring open science practices into policy analysis. It complies with the highest levels of the [Open Policy Analysis (OPA) Guidelines](https://www.bitss.org/opa/community-standards/). We also look to demonstrate tools, ideas, and practices through which OPA can be implemented in practice. This exercise, and future case studies, in turn will inform the Guidelines.
